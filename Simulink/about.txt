 SIMULINK Stage: FIR System Design, Simulation, and HDL Setup
------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT WAS DONE:
--------------
The core design of the FIR filter system was developed in Simulink using a direct-form, pipelined structure capable of processing complex fixed-point input data. 
Functional testing of the entire filter system was performed through simulation using generated input vectors. HDL Workflow Advisor was then used to generate 
synthesizable Verilog code and export a Vivado-compatible project structure.

WHY IT WAS DONE:
----------------
This Simulink model serves as the basis for actual hardware implementation. Directly generating HDL code and Vivado project files from a tested Simulink design allows
for a streamlined, error-minimized workflow. It bridges high-level design and low-level hardware deployment efficiently.

HOW IT WAS DONE:
----------------
- FIR core implemented using multiply-accumulate blocks and pipelined adders
- Control logic built using FSMs to sequence memory read/write operations
- Address generation handled by parameterised counters
- Dual-port RAM blocks used for input/output buffering
- Simulation driven by a testbench with control flags and counters
- HDL Workflow Advisor used to generate Verilog and Vivado project files
