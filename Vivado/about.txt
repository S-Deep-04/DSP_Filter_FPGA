 VIVADO Stage: System Integration, IP Packaging, Synthesis
-------------------------------------------------------

WHAT WAS DONE:
--------------
The Verilog HDL files generated from Simulink were imported into Vivado and packaged as a custom IP block. 
A complete block design was created using the Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC Processing System. The FIR filter IP 
was connected to AXI BRAM controllers and dual-port BRAMs for real and imaginary input/output data. 
Additional logic such as AXI SmartConnect, GPIO, and vector logic blocks were used to manage control 
and data flow. Synthesis and implementation were successfully completed with positive timing closure. 
Finally, the hardware design was exported as an `.xsa` file for Vitis to enable PS-side software development.

WHY IT WAS DONE:
----------------
This stage prepares the complete programmable logic (PL) system for deployment on the FPGA. The custom IP 
is integrated with memory and control interfaces through Vivado’s block design environment. Exporting the 
hardware model to Vitis is essential, as Vitis allows software running on the Zynq PS to:
  - Generate test inputs and write them into BRAM
  - Control the FIR filter IP execution
  - Fetch the output from BRAM for analysis or display

Without Vitis, there would be no way to dynamically interact with the filter IP from the software side 
of the Zynq SoC.

HOW IT WAS DONE:
----------------
- Imported HDL IP from Simulink-generated Verilog using IP Packager
- Created a block design integrating:
  • Zynq MPSoC Processing System
  • AXI BRAM Controllers connected to input/output BRAM blocks
  • AXI SmartConnect for AXI interface routing
  • GPIO blocks for manual control and monitoring
  • Vector Logic to extract necessary bits from control buses
- Set address mapping using Address Editor
- Configured the design with proper I/O constraints via XDC file
- Performed synthesis, implementation, and generated `.bit` and `.xsa` files
- Exported hardware design to Vitis for software interaction
